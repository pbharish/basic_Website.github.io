            A computer program can easily produce gibberish - especially if it has been provided with garbage beforehand. 
            This program does something a little different. It takes a block of text as input and works out the proportion of 
            characters within the text according to a chosen order. For example, an order of 2 means the program looks at pairs of letters,
            an order of 3 means triplets of letters and so on. The software can regurgitate random text that is controlled by the proportion
            of characters. The results can be quite surprising.In the first place we have granted to God, and by this our present charter 
            confirmed for us and our heirs forever that the English Church shall be free, and shall have her rights entire, 
            and her liberties inviolate; and we will that it be thus observed; which is apparent from this that the freedom of elections, 
            which is reckoned most important and very essential to the English Church, we, of our pure and unconstrained will, did grant,
            and did by our charter confirm and did obtain the ratification of the same from our lord, Pope Innocent III, 
            before the quarrel arose between us and our barons: and this we will observe, and our will is that it be observed in good faith.
